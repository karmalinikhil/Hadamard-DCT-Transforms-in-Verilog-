#  Simulation Results

This folder contains the waveform screenshots and simulation outputs generated from the testbench of the Hadamard transform project.

# Files Included
- `HT_test01_15.png` – Waveform output showing successful transform logic, when a 4x4 input matrix of decimal 15 was provided to the transform logic.
- `HT_test02_12.png` – Waveform output showing successful transform logic, when a 4x4 input matrix of decimal 12 was provided to the transform logic.


These results validate the correct flow of data from FIFO to RAM, and into the adder logic, completing the 4x4 Hadamard matrix generation.
