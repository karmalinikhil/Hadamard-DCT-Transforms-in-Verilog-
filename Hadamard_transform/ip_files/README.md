#  IP Cores Used

This folder contains the IP core configuration files (`.xci`) used in the Hadamard transform project.

##  IPs Included
- FIFO Generator
- Block Memory Generator
- Adder/Subtractor IPs
- Custom fifo_gen_01.v file, which was used for storage of the output elements.
- (Add more as per your IP usage)

These IPs are auto-generated by Vivado and can be re-generated by Vivado when the project is opened using the `.xpr` file.

>  You only need the `.xci` files â€” Vivado will recreate the IP source files during synthesis or simulation.
