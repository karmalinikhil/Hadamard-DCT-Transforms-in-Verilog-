Hadamard and DCT Transform in Verilog

This repository contains Verilog implementations of the Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). These transforms are commonly used in signal processing, image compression, and other digital applications.

Overview

Hadamard Transform: A fast, orthogonal transform useful for data encoding, signal processing, and error correction.

Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT): Primarily used in image and video compression (e.g., JPEG, MPEG) to transform data from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.

Features

Efficient Verilog implementations of both transforms

Supports configurable input sizes

Tested in simulation environments

Modular and scalable design
